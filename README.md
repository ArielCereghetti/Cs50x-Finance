# Cs50x-Finance
This is the project i made in my Cs50 course from Harvard, it's a simulation of a finance page where I practiced my fullstack skill

# If you'd like to run it in your own computer:
You will have to install everything on the "requirements.txt" file and then run the command "flask run" on the same directory as 
the "app.py" file and it will run on your computer
